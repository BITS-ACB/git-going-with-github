> **The Central Project: Agent Forge**
>
> This workshop is built around a real, live open source project: **[Agent Forge](https://github.com/accesswatch/agent-forge)** — six GitHub Copilot agents and 28 slash commands for accessible, agentic repository management. It was built by your facilitator and is MIT-licensed.
>
> You will fork it, understand it, contribute to it, and personalize it. By the end of Day 2, your name is in its commit history.
>
> **Agent Forge does not replace what you learn on Day 1. It amplifies it.** The agents only make sense when you already understand the skills they automate. That is why Day 1 comes first — and why every guide in this repository shows you the manual path before it shows you the agent path.

---

## What Is This Event?

During this two-day workshop, you will learn how to confidently navigate and contribute to open source projects on GitHub using:

- A **screen reader** (NVDA on Windows, JAWS on Windows, or VoiceOver on macOS)
- **Keyboard-only navigation** — no mouse required
- **GitHub Copilot** (Day 2) — AI-assisted writing and coding in the browser and in VS Code

By the end of this event, you will have made **real contributions** to a real repository. Not simulated. Not pretend. Real.

---

## Who Is This For?

This event is designed for:

- People new to GitHub who use assistive technology
- Developers who use screen readers and want to contribute to open source
- Anyone who is curious about accessible development workflows
- Sighted participants are welcome — all content is keyboard-navigable for everyone

You do **not** need to know how to code to participate and contribute meaningfully. Documentation improvements, issue filing, accessibility bug reports, and code reviews are all valuable contributions.

---

## Two-Day Overview

| Day | Focus | What You Will Do |
|-----|-------|-----------------|
| **Day 1** | GitHub Foundations | Set up your environment, learn GitHub navigation with your screen reader, file your first issue, open your first pull request |
| **Day 2** | VS Code + Agent Forge | Bridge from the browser to **github.dev** (VS Code in your browser — no install needed), then step into **Visual Studio Code** on the desktop, learn VS Code basics, use GitHub Copilot, activate the six Agent Forge agents, run agentic workflows in the cloud, and ship a real PR upstream to `accesswatch/agent-forge` |

### The Journey Arc

This is not a two-day course with two separate syllabi. It is one arc.

```
Day 1 — Learn the skill in the browser
  Navigate → Issue → Pull Request → Review → Merge

     ↓  (bridge: press . on any GitHub repo — VS Code opens right in your browser)

github.dev — VS Code on the web, no install needed
  Same keyboard shortcuts · Same screen reader mode · Edit files · Open PRs
  What it cannot do: no terminal, no Copilot agents, no local extensions

     ↓  (you've earned the desktop — now it makes sense)

Day 2 — Deepen with VS Code + Agent Forge
  Learn VS Code basics → Copilot inline → Copilot Chat
  @daily-briefing → @issue-tracker → @pr-review → @analytics → ship upstream
```

Every skill you build on Day 1 maps directly to an Agent Forge command on Day 2. The agent is not a shortcut — it is a multiplier. You have to understand what it is doing to know when it is wrong.

**By the end of Day 2, you will have:**
- A fork of `agent-forge` with your personalized preferences
- At least one merged PR in a real open source project
- Your name in the commit history of `accesswatch/agent-forge`
- A working set of six AI agents that travel with your fork to any repository you apply them to

## Screen Reader Users: Start Here

Before doing anything else, please read [**00 — Pre-Workshop Setup**](docs/00-pre-workshop-setup.md). It will walk you through:

- Configuring your screen reader for GitHub
- Verifying GitHub's modern interface is working (may already be active — instructions include how to check and enable if needed)
- Turning off settings that make screen reader navigation harder
- Verifying everything works before Day 1 begins

---

## The Goal of This Event

Open source software is built by people. Accessibility bugs in open source affect millions of people who use assistive technology every day. By learning to contribute — even something as small as filing a clear, detailed accessibility issue — you become part of fixing that. That matters.

**You don't have to write a single line of code to make open source more accessible.**

And by the end of Day 2, you will not just be a learner. You will be a product maker — someone who has shipped something real to a project that other people use.

---

## Questions Before the Event?

- **Discussion Forum:** [Join the conversation](https://github.com/BITS-ACB/git-going-with-github/discussions) — ask questions, connect with fellow participants, share ideas
- **Email:** [support@bits-acb.org](mailto:support@bits-acb.org)
- **File an issue** in this repository if something in these docs is unclear
- **Community:** [GitHub Accessibility Discussions](https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/categories/accessibility)
