> **Already registered?** Complete the [**Pre-Workshop Setup Guide**](https://bits-acb.github.io/git-going-with-github/COMING_SOON.html) before March 6. It walks you through GitHub account setup, screen reader configuration, VS Code, and GitHub Copilot - with instructions for NVDA, JAWS, and VoiceOver.

---

## Step 1 - Sign Up on GitHub

File a GitHub issue to register. This is intentional - filing an issue is one of the first skills you will learn in this workshop, so you are already practicing.

> [**Start Step 1 - File your registration issue**](https://github.com/BITS-ACB/git-going-with-github/issues/new?template=workshop-registration.yml&title=%5BREGISTER%5D+GIT+Going+with+GitHub+-+March+2026)

You will need a free GitHub account. If you do not have one yet, see the [Pre-Workshop Setup Guide](https://bits-acb.github.io/git-going-with-github/COMING_SOON.html) for step-by-step instructions.

**Note:** The issue title is pre-filled and required by GitHub. You do not need to change it - just fill out the form fields below it and submit.

The form asks for:

- **First Name** (required) - your first name as you would like to be addressed during the workshop
- **Last Name** (required)
- **Email Address** (required) - we will use this to send you Zoom links and workshop materials before the event
- **GitHub Username** (required) - the one that appears in your profile URL at github.com/your-username
- **GitHub Proficiency Level** (required) - a dropdown from "Brand new" to "Experienced" so we can prepare the right level of support
- **Primary Screen Reader** (optional) - which screen reader you primarily use (NVDA, JAWS, VoiceOver, or other)
- **Questions or Accommodations** (optional) - anything we should know or arrange before the workshop

After you submit, you will receive an automated confirmation comment on your issue.

## Step 2 - Register for the Zoom Session

After completing Step 1, register for the Zoom session so you receive the meeting link before the workshop.

> [**Start Step 2 - Register on Zoom**](#zoom-link-coming-soon)

The Zoom registration link will be posted here before the workshop. Check back soon or watch for an email at the address you provided in Step 1.

**Zoom accessibility notes:**

- The [Zoom](https://zoom.us/) client works well with [NVDA](https://www.nvaccess.org/download/), [JAWS](https://www.freedomscientific.com/products/software/jaws/), and [VoiceOver](https://support.apple.com/guide/voiceover/welcome/mac)

## What Happens Next

Once you have completed both steps:

1. You will see a confirmation comment on your GitHub issue (Step 1)
2. You will receive a Zoom confirmation email (Step 2)
3. Complete the [Pre-Workshop Setup Guide](https://bits-acb.github.io/git-going-with-github/COMING_SOON.html) before March 6 - it covers GitHub account setup, screen reader configuration, VS Code, and GitHub Copilot
