> **Already registered?** Complete the [**Pre-Workshop Setup Guide**](https://bits-acb.github.io/git-going-with-github/COMING_SOON.html) before March 7. It walks you through GitHub account setup, screen reader configuration, [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), and [GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot) - with instructions for NVDA, JAWS, and VoiceOver.

## Step 1 - Register for the Zoom Session

Register for the Zoom session so you receive the meeting link before the workshop.

> [**Start Step 1 - Register on Zoom**](#zoom-link-coming-soon)

The Zoom registration link will be posted here before the workshop. Check back soon or watch for an email after completing Step 2.

**Zoom accessibility notes:**

- The [Zoom](https://zoom.us/) client works well with [NVDA](https://www.nvaccess.org/download/), [JAWS](https://www.freedomscientific.com/products/software/jaws/), and [VoiceOver](https://support.apple.com/guide/voiceover/welcome/mac)

## Step 2 - Sign Up on GitHub

File a GitHub issue to register. This is intentional - filing an issue is one of the first skills you will learn in this workshop, so you are already practicing.

You must be signed into a [GitHub](https://github.com) account to file the issue. If you do not have one yet, create one first using the steps below - then come back to file your registration issue.

### Need a GitHub Account?

If you do not have a GitHub account yet, follow these steps:

1. Open your browser and go to [github.com/signup](https://github.com/signup)
2. Enter your **email address** and press Tab or activate Continue
3. Create a **password** (at least 8 characters, 15+ recommended) and continue
4. Choose a **username** - lowercase letters, numbers, and hyphens only. Keep it professional; it represents you in the open source community. GitHub will tell you immediately if the name is taken
5. Choose whether to receive product updates by email (y or n)
6. **Human verification step** - GitHub presents a CAPTCHA puzzle. Screen reader users: look for an "Audio" or "Try an audio challenge" button. If neither is accessible, contact [support@bits-acb.org](mailto:support@bits-acb.org) and we will help
7. Activate **Create account**
8. GitHub sends a **launch code** to your email - copy it, return to the browser, and type it into the verification field. Check your spam folder if it does not arrive within a few minutes
9. You will see a "Welcome to GitHub" personalization page - you can skip it

After creating your account, check your email for a message from GitHub with the subject "Please verify your email address" and activate the link inside it.

**Enable two-factor authentication** (strongly recommended): Go to [github.com/settings/security](https://github.com/settings/security), find "Two-factor authentication," and activate "Enable." An authenticator app (Microsoft Authenticator, Google Authenticator, or Authy) is the most reliable option.

### File Your Registration Issue

> [**Start Step 2 - File your registration issue**](https://github.com/BITS-ACB/git-going-with-github/issues/new?template=workshop-registration.yml&title=%5BREGISTER%5D+GIT+Going+with+GitHub+-+March+2026)

**Note:** The issue title is pre-filled and required by GitHub. You do not need to change it - just fill out the form fields below it and submit.

The form asks for:

- **First Name** (required) - your first name as you would like to be addressed during the workshop
- **Last Name** (required)
- **Email Address** (required) - we will use this to send you Zoom links and workshop materials before the event
- **GitHub Proficiency Level** (required) - a dropdown from "Brand new" to "Experienced" so we can prepare the right level of support
- **Primary Screen Reader** (optional) - which screen reader you primarily use (NVDA, JAWS, VoiceOver, or other)
- **Questions or Accommodations** (optional) - anything we should know or arrange before the workshop

After you submit, you will receive an automated confirmation comment on your issue. Your GitHub username is captured automatically - you do not need to enter it.

## What Happens Next

Once you have completed both steps:

1. You will receive a Zoom confirmation email (Step 1)
2. You will see a confirmation comment on your GitHub issue (Step 2)
3. Complete the [Pre-Workshop Setup Guide](https://bits-acb.github.io/git-going-with-github/COMING_SOON.html) before March 7 - it covers GitHub account setup, screen reader configuration, [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), and [GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot)
4. Questions? Email [support@bits-acb.org](mailto:support@bits-acb.org)
